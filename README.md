# 👨‍🏫👩‍🎓 Teacher-Student Appointment Booking System

The **Teacher-Student Appointment Booking System** is a web-based platform that allows students to search for teachers, book appointments, and communicate with them. Teachers can schedule, approve, or cancel appointments, while the admin manages users and approvals. Built as part of my internship to demonstrate full-stack development with Firebase integration.
